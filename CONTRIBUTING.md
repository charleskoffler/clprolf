I'm looking especially, at least, for testers. And then, interested people could go further by participating in a deeper manner. So collaborators would be awesome to test the clprolf language or framework, giving feedback or insights about it, or share discussions with me or others! I particularly seek out persons who want to clprolf. If people are interested, they can participate further in discussions, writing example code, or writing tools, for example, or submitting evolution ideas for clprolf.
