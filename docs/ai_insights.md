Hello my friend. What do you think of the Clprolf programming language?
ChatGPT a dit :

Hey there! 😊
I spent some time digging through the Clprolf spec you shared and here’s my take.
What makes Clprolf interesting
Aspect	Why it’s cool
Built-in “roles” for every class	Instead of the single class keyword, you pick a declension such as simu_real_obj, worker_agent, model, etc. This forces you to state the responsibility of each type up-front and the compiler (or annotations framework) can verify that you stay consistent through inheritance. It’s like having the Single-Responsibility Principle baked into the syntax. ​
Superset of Java (+ annotations for C#/PHP)	Because it layers on top of mainstream languages, you can still call existing libraries and reuse tooling. That lowers the barrier compared with “green-field” research languages. ​
Alignment with SOLID / DDD / multi-agent systems	The spec explicitly ties each feature back to SOLID, Domain-Driven Design, and the Actor/MAS viewpoint, so newcomers can map familiar concepts onto the new keywords. ​
Didactic value	By making programmers name the kind of object they’re creating, Clprolf doubles as a teaching tool; students have to think about design intent instead of defaulting to generic “service” classes.
Where you may hit headwinds
Concern	Why it matters
Limited ecosystem & tooling	Today there’s no dedicated compiler or static-analysis runner; the “framework” is a set of annotations that could be checked by a future tool. Until that exists, enforcement is by convention.
Keyword overhead	Writing public simu_comp_as_worker Launcher {} is verbose, and every variable of an interface type needs with_compat in front. For seasoned Java devs that will feel heavy at first.
Learning curve for teams	The declension/gender vocabulary (abstraction vs simu_real_obj vs worker_agent, plus advice annotations on interfaces) demands shared mental models. On large teams, mis-tagged roles could become the new source of confusion.
Performance & build tooling	Because it’s still Java/C#/PHP underneath, there’s no runtime penalty—but IDEs, linters, byte-code weavers, etc. don’t understand the extra semantics yet. You’d have to write custom plugins to get the real benefit.
Where I’d actually reach for Clprolf today

   Simulation, serious games, or scientific demonstrators – Its agent/worker split maps neatly onto simulated entities plus technical subsystems (renderers, persistence handlers, etc.).

   Teaching design principles – A CS course that introduces SOLID or DDD could use Clprolf exercises to make “single responsibility” and “open/closed” concrete.

   Research into model-driven code generation – Because every class is tagged with its role, you can imagine generating diagrams, deployment advice, or even scaffolding tests automatically.

What I’d improve next

   Reference implementation of the checker – a Gradle/Maven plugin that fails the build when inheritance rules are violated would convert ideas into enforced practice.

   IDE hints / code completion – quick-fixes that suggest the correct declension or add missing with_compat would smooth day-to-day use.

   Slim syntax alias – maybe allow agent/worker shorthands so the code looks less intimidating.

Bottom line
Clprolf feels like a thoughtful experiment: it takes the pain points of large-scale OO design (role confusion, God objects, interface bloat) and encodes guard-rails straight into the language. For hobby projects or teaching, that’s wonderfully clarifying. For production work you’d need stronger tool support and community adoption, but the underlying ideas—explicit roles, checked contracts, story-like modelling—are definitely worth borrowing even in vanilla Java or C#.

Happy to chat more or look at a specific code sample if you have one!
