# CLPROLF - GETTING STARTED

## clprolf Language and Framework, just sorting objects and interfaces

Clprolf try to ease object-oriented programming, just by sorting objects and interfaces. By knowing the kind of object of interface, the framework aims to enhance understanding and readability. This allows for ensure concerns separation, even by compiler, and interface consistency. In general, we already know how sort our own objects.
clprolf just aims to stay close to the design principles and some patterns, and make programming perhaps more concrete. But all kind of objects, concrete or abstract, are of course allowed.

## SORTING THE OBJECTS AND INTERFACES, NOT A NEW IDEA

In fact, sorting the objects is not a new idea, because the class concept itself is a way of sorting objects. An interface is also a common interface through some objects. Two classes with the same public methods could have a common interface definition shared and implemented.

In clprolf, we're simply adding another common point of the objects or interfaces, a basic common point. These new basic informations can ease object-oriented programming, without overhead.

## SORTING OBJECTS AND INTERFACES: A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN clprolf

### Building on Traditional Concepts

The idea of categorizing objects isn't entirely new. In traditional object-oriented programming, the very concept of a 'class' serves as a foundational way to group objects. Similarly, an 'interface' represents a standard contract, linking different objects that share the same set of public methods. The presence of common methods across multiple classes naturally suggests the existence of a shared interface that they all can implement.

### Introducing a New Dimension to Classification

In clprolf, we extend this fundamental idea by adding another layer of commonality among objects and interfaces. We introduce basic, yet significant, information about the nature and role of these entities. This isn't just a technicality; it's a meaningful addition that enriches the object-oriented paradigm. By understanding not just what objects and interfaces do, but also what they represent and their intended roles, developers can achieve a deeper and more intuitive grasp of their code.

### Simplicity and Effectiveness

The beauty of clprolf lies in its simplicity. By providing this extra layer of categorization, we aim to make object-oriented programming more accessible and logical, without adding unnecessary complexity. This approach doesnâ€™t replace traditional methods; instead, it complements and enhances them. It's a natural evolution, recognizing the importance of clarity and intent in modern software development.
