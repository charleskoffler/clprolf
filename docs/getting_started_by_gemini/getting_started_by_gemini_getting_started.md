# Simol: A Simulation-Oriented Approach to Programming

This section delves deeper into Simol's unique approach to object-oriented programming, focusing on how it views software as a network of communicating applications.

## Simol's Software Viewpoint:

   Micro-Applications: Simol perceives software as a collection of interconnected micro-applications, similar to how services communicate on the internet.
   
   Objects as Applications: Each object in Simol can be considered a self-contained application.
   
   Micro-Simulations and Tasks: These applications can be further composed of even smaller micro-simulations or purely computational tasks, resembling an operating system.
   
   Business and Scientific Focus: Objects can represent management applications, scientific simulations, or anything with a defined business or scientific function.

## Simol Object Types:

   simu_real_world_obj: These objects simulate real-world entities and have methods to represent their behavior.
   
   simu_comp_as_worker: These objects perform computational tasks for the computer, seen as a dedicated worker.
   
   model_real_world_obj: These are purely data objects that represent models of real-world entities. They lack methods.
   
   information objects: These are general data structures used to store information and lack methods.

## Comparison to Traditional OOP:

Simol aligns more closely with Alan Kay's original vision of objects as communicating micro-computers. It extends this concept to a network of micro-applications.

## Advantages of Simulation Perspective:

   Reasoning with Real-World Objects: The simulation viewpoint allows for easier reasoning about real-world objects directly within the code.
   
   Worker Mentality for Computers: Viewing the computer as a worker simplifies the approach to assigning computational tasks.

This breakdown clarifies Simol's object-oriented structure and its unique perspective on software development. By treating objects as mini-applications and tasks as simulations, Simol aims to create a more intuitive and efficient programming experience.
