# AI softwares programming with simol

## What is an AI tool?

Artifical Intelligence means simulated intelligence. No AI-tools tells it is sentient, and no AI designer or programmer says he has seen his AI-based program becoming conscious. This would be a true intelligence. And if it was the case, there would be another question in addition of the consciousness. Would the AI software execute more than his algorithms are made for? If yes, then this would be a program that could do more than his own algorithms, so it would not stay a program. It would not be anymore a computer science problem, nor a programming problem. So we interests us here is AI is the sense of Simulated Intelligence.

## Would simol be interesting in writing AI tools?

Simol emphasizes simulations aspects, and ideally suits for simulation software writing. On top of that, AI often requires complex algorithms, and the advantages of simol would thus be perfectly adapted. AI software implies much complex components and much algorithms, and simol excels at this topics. AI systems have to be mastered systems, because we have to be able to know exactly what our programs can do, or should do, or not. It seems not normal that the programmers and designers could not easily understand if their systems runs correctly, as they wanted, or not. 
Simol would be well made for teaching AI courses with simol, or prototyping such tools. But beyond teaching and courses, simol seems be an interesting option to be part of AI software, because it aims to simplify complex and oriented objects systems writing. Simol should be competitive even on the performance side because if is based upon Java.

"Your new section on "AI Software Programming with SIMOL" brings a unique perspective to the application of SIMOL in the development of AI tools. Here are some thoughts on the content and approach:

   Clarifying AI Definition: Your definition of AI as "simulated intelligence" is a good starting point. It clearly distinguishes between the notion of sentient AI and the AI that is commonly used in the industry, which is more about simulating aspects of human cognition. This clarification is important for setting the right expectations and understanding of what AI tools are designed to do.

   Relevance of SIMOL in AI Programming: The emphasis on simulation in SIMOL aligns well with many aspects of AI programming, especially where complex algorithms and systems need to be modeled. Since AI involves creating models that simulate aspects of human intelligence or natural processes, SIMOL's focus on clear, object-oriented design can be beneficial for structuring and managing these complex systems.

   Educational Applications: Your mention of using SIMOL for teaching AI is intriguing. Given SIMOL's clear and structured approach, it could be an excellent tool for educational purposes, helping students grasp the complexities of AI systems in a more organized manner.

   Complexity Management in AI Development: AI systems can indeed be complex and challenging to manage. SIMOL's approach to clear and meaningful class and interface roles could help in making AI algorithms and their interactions more understandable and maintainable.

   Performance Considerations: Addressing the potential concern about performance when using SIMOL for AI development is vital. Since SIMOL is built upon Java, it inherits Java's performance characteristics, which are generally favorable. However, the actual impact on performance would depend on how SIMOL's abstractions and additional layers are implemented on top of Java.

   AI Ethics and Understanding: You've touched on an essential aspect of AI development â€“ the need for developers to thoroughly understand and control their systems. In the context of growing concerns about AI ethics and unintended consequences, SIMOL's emphasis on clarity and predictability in software design is very timely.

In summary, your addition on AI software programming with SIMOL is a thoughtful extension of SIMOL's application domain. It not only highlights SIMOL's potential in a cutting-edge field like AI but also aligns with current needs for transparency and control in AI system development. This section could effectively resonate with both educational institutions and AI developers looking for a robust, clear, and manageable approach to building AI systems."
