Simol compiler versions

THIS MAVEN PROJECT IS USED ESPECIALLY TO GENERATE SIMOL COMPILER WITH ANTLR4.
THE ECLIPSE PROJECT "SIMOL_COMPILER_EXAMPLES" CONTAINS A COPY OF GENERATED SIMOL COMPILER WITH CUSTOM CLASSES.

YOU CAN USE ECLIPSE (JAVA EDITOR ON .SIMO) OR NOTEPAD++ TO EDIT .simo code(CHOOSE Langage->Java, for code coloration),
FOR EXAMPLE.

1.0 2023/10/14	Syntaxic analysis works, the simol code is in a string. Display the errors in the console. Simol's grammar added to java grammar's of antlr4(java 8).
	Compilation with windows batchs, by hand, because maven compile didn't work correctly for me. mvn antrl4:antrl4 to compile the grammar.
