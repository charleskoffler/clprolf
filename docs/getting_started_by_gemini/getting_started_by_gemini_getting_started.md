# LET'S UNDERSTAND SIMOL FROM GEMINI'S EXPLANATIONS
Let's present in these documents, the explanations of Google Gemini, from the getting started documents of simol. All these texts have been written by Gemini from the equivalent simol's documents.

# Simol: A Deep Dive into Object-Oriented Programming

This explanation dives deeper into Simol's approach to object-oriented programming (OOP) and how it differs from the traditional paradigm. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

## Simol's View on Software:

   Set of Communicating Applications: Simol views software as a collection of micro-applications that interact with each other.
    
   Objects as Applications: Each object represents an individual application, potentially containing smaller applications within it.
    
   Real-World vs. Computational Focus:
        simu_real_world_obj: Simulates real-world entities and their behavior.
        
   		simu_comp_as_worker: Represents purely computational tasks for the computer.

## Data Objects:

   model_real_world_obj: Data objects that model real-world entities but lack methods (functions).
   
   information Objects: Pure data structures without methods, used for general data storage.

## Comparison with Traditional OOP:

   Simol Aligns with Alan Kay's Vision: Simol's approach aligns more closely with Alan Kay's original concept of objects as communicating micro-computers.

## Advantages of Simol's Approach:

   Reasoning with Real-World Objects: The simulation perspective allows for easier reasoning about how the program interacts with real-world entities.
    
   Simplified Worker View of Computer: Treating the computer as a worker simplifies understanding its role in the system.

Overall, Simol offers a unique perspective on OOP that emphasizes communication and real-world simulation. Here are some additional thoughts:

   The concept of micro-applications within objects is interesting and could potentially lead to more modular and reusable code.
    
   Providing clear examples of how simu_real_world_obj and simu_comp_as_worker interact in practice would be helpful for understanding their functionalities.

It would be interesting to see how Simol handles concurrency and communication between these micro-applications.
