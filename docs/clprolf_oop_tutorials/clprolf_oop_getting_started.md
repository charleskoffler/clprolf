# How to Use the Clprolf Framework with an OOP Mindset - Introduction

It‚Äôs possible to use the Clprolf Framework while keeping a fully object-oriented approach, even though Clprolf itself is not based on traditional OOP.

To do so, simply don‚Äôt use all the annotations, and rely instead on class/interface declensions and roles, which can support your reasoning when organizing responsibilities.
üß© Example ‚Äì Structuring Responsibilities in a Class

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre about to create an OrderManager class.
You start realizing that the class might mix several different responsibilities.
That‚Äôs common ‚Äî and the definition of ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù is often vague in OOP.

Clprolf helps by suggesting clear role-based class types, to encourage clean separation.

```java
public class OrderManager {

    private List<Order> orders;

    public OrderManager() {
        orders = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addOrder(Order order) {
        orders.add(order);
    }

    public void printOrders() {
        for (Order order : orders) {
            System.out.println(order.toString());
        }
    }

    public void saveOrdersToFile(String filePath) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath)) {
            for (Order order : orders) {
                writer.write(order.toString() + "\n");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public double calculateTotalRevenue() {
        double total = 0.0;
        for (Order order : orders) {
            total += order.getTotalPrice();
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

‚úÖ Refactored Version with Clprolf Roles

Here, we choose to keep the business logic (managing orders and calculating revenue) inside an @Agent class.
The printing and persistence tasks are moved into two @Worker_agent classes, as they belong to the technical layer.

This also allows reuse and separation, such as implementing a DAO pattern for persistence.

```java
@Agent
public class OrderManager {

    private List<Order> orders;

    public OrderManager() {
        orders = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addOrder(Order order) {
        orders.add(order);
    }

    public double calculateTotalRevenue() {
        double total = 0.0;
        for (Order order : orders) {
            total += order.getTotalPrice();
        }
        return total;
    }

    public List<Order> getOrders() {
        return orders;
    }
}

@Worker_agent
public class OrderPrinter {

    private OrderManager manager;

    public OrderPrinter(OrderManager manager) {
        this.manager = manager;
    }

    public void printOrders() {
        for (Order order : this.manager.getOrders()) {
            System.out.println(order.toString());
        }
    }
}

@Worker_agent
public class OrderPersistence {

    private OrderManager manager;

    public OrderPersistence(OrderManager manager) {
        this.manager = manager;
    }

    public void saveOrdersToFile(String filePath) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath)) {
            for (Order order : this.manager.getOrders()) {
                writer.write(order.toString() + "\n");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

üí° Summary

This is not ‚Äúpure‚Äù Clprolf usage ‚Äî but a way to apply it in OOP while keeping your existing mindset.

You can think of @Agent and @Worker_agent as support annotations to help clarify and separate responsibilities in your object-oriented code.

It‚Äôs up to you to use more of the framework later, but even at this level, Clprolf already provides clarity and structure.

### Start Soft with Clprolf ‚Äî Use @Indef_obj and @Compat_interf as Placeholders

When using Clprolf within a traditional OOP mindset,
you don‚Äôt need to classify every class or interface right away.

In fact, if you're unsure about the role or responsibility of a class at first, that‚Äôs completely normal.

To help you transition smoothly:

   Use @Indef_obj for your classes when the role is not yet clear.

   Use @Compat_interf for your interfaces until a more precise purpose emerges.

These markers are completely neutral.
They keep you in the OOP flow ‚Äî and they allow for a clean upgrade later:

   Once the responsibility becomes clearer,
    just replace @Indef_obj with something more accurate like @Agent, @Worker_agent, or a declension without methods.
    And replace @Compat_interf with @Compat_interf_version or another appropriate interface role.
