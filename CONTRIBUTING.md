I'm looking especially, at least, for testers. And then, interested people could go further by participating in a deeper manner. So collaborators would be awesome to test the simol language or framework, giving feedback or insights about it, or share discussions with me or others!
I particularly seek out persons who want to test the language or the simol framework for java, C# and PHP8. If people are interested, they can participate further in discussions, writing example code, or writing tools, for example, or submitting evolution ideas for simol.
