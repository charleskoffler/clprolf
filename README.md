# clprolf language and framework

CLear PROgramming Language and Framework.
Clprolf is a niche language designed to help create systems with a mindful and coherent structure.
It offers a clear and thoughtful framework to build software with consistency, purpose, and long-term stability.

Clprolf is a specialized, guided language. It features predefined, dedicated components and applies strict constraints to inheritance and interfaces, with a strong focus on algorithmic programming.

It is particularly suited for:

   complex systems,

   simulation and MAS-like applications,

   or educational purposes.

Clprolf also serves as a tool to aid memory and understanding of class/interface structures â€” much like a mnemonic or memory palace â€” ideal for those who struggle to retain large, abstract architectures.

Additionally, Clprolf is a language for testing, explaining, and validating scientific theories â€” by simulation, algorithm description, and clear actor modeling.

I present both:

   the Clprolf programming language, and

   the Clprolf framework, a lightweight annotation-based framework that brings Clprolf concepts to Java, C#, or PHP.

Clprolf is minimalistic, to simplify development.
It is a powerful teaching tool, but not designed only for teaching.

Programming in Clprolf focuses on functional problems and describes the interactions of actors.
For technical details, it describes what a worker must do, not how it is done internally.

Clprolf is a language designed for clarity, simplicity, and ease of use.
It inherently embeds object-oriented principles and significant design patterns â€” a rare feature in a programming language.

Clprolf supports both:

   algorithm design, with help from typed classes and interface constraints,

   and structural clarity, through roles and modifiers.

   ðŸ§  One of the main â€” perhaps the most important â€” goals of Clprolf is to make writing programs easier.

Programming is the interweaving of design and algorithmic concerns.
Clprolf supports both.
